Git -
git is a free open source distributed version control system.
designed to handle projects.
git is a tool.


Github -
is webhosting service provider.
here we put or source code of any project. add collaborators, create branch and may more.
github is a web based hosting service which uses git tool.

Repository -
collections of files and directories that are managed by git.
contains all the informantion about project,its history(who/when/where).
It allows multiple collaborators.

Local Repository -
is the Repository that exists in our own computer.
contains files, branches, commits and other informantion related to our project.
we can use git commands to manage it.

Remote Repository -
is a copy of Repository that exists on a server.(github/gitlab/bitbucket).
allows you to share code to other developres and collaborate on same project.

.git directory  -
when run *git int* command on any local directory, it becomes local Repository and .git hidded directory is created.
GIT uses this directory to store all the metadata(commit history, branches, tags, config settings) for that Repository.

files and folders in .git directory-
  head            - 
  objects         -folder
  refs            -folder
  configs         -
  hooks           -folder
  index           -
  logs            -folder
  branches        -
  description     -
  info            -folder
  FETCH_HEAD      -
  COMMIT_EDITMSG  -
  ORIG_HEAD       -

untracked files -
when we create a new file in our git Repository, git doesnot automatically start trackingit.
git is unaware of this file, so git doesnot monitor this file for any changes.
if you accidently detete this untracked file ,it will be lost forever.

tracked file  -
when you initially create a git Repository, no files are tracked by default.
you need to tell git which files you want to track.
command - git add filename.extension 

unstaged  -
when we do any changes in tracked file, git is aware of those changes but they are considered to be unstagged untill we expictly tell git to include them in the staging area.
when we rename a file or do some changes in that file this will not be in staging area by default. we have to run git add command to move that file in staging.
command- git status will show you that the file has been modified,but it will be listed as unstagged.
unstagged shanges were not included in next commit.

stagged and staging area  -
when we run a command git add filename , then this file will be included in staging area.
we have a big module to develop. we have finished some part which is working as expected, then we will move that changes to stagging area and then work next part.

changes which are included in stagging are are taken for next commit. 

snapshot  - 
it refers to a specific point in time in the history of git Repository.
when we create a commin in git, we are essentially taking a snapshot(checkpoint) of the current state of the repository at that moment.
each commit in a git repository is a unique snapshot that refers to the specific version of that project.
snapshot captures all the changes(who/when/where/what) we have made to the file in our repository.
each commit creates a unique snapshot/checkpoint and a new version.
we can come back to this point anytime.
each commit has a unique identifier(hash - a long string of characters).

head  - 
head is the reference to the most recent commit that we have made.
head is the pointer which points to the new commit of that branch.
when we create a new commit git updates the head to point to the new commit.

branch  -
branch is a separate line of development that allows us to work on different parts pf project. which does not affect the other branches of our repo.
***
when we create a new branch it doesnot create a copy of all the files and folder in our repo. It creates a new pointer to a specific commit in our repo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tag   -
a tag is a label that is assigned to a specific commit in a repo.
it is used to mark imp points in the proejt history.
they are simply a way to mark a specific commit and make it easy to refer to it in the future.

git tag tagname (ex  git tag drag_drop_working)

by above command we have added tag to that recent commit with name drag_drop_working. 
after that we created some new files and did some modification and then committed. but this disturbed the project on that branch. now we want to go back to that working commit where we had given a tag. to do that 

git checkout drag_drop_working

adding a tag to specific commit
git tag v0.1 605ec110e07e39a8825e64a71423166831140857

git tag --list 
will  give you the list of all the tags

delete a tag - 
git tag -d drag_drop_working

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rollback  -
we have made multiple commits suppose commit-1,commit-2,commit-3..............commit-10.
now we are getting some problems after commit-8. I want to go back to commot-8. going back to that working commit is called rollback.rollback will remove all the commits after the commit-8.
simply going back to any commit of that branch on the repo is roll back.

rollback last commit -
git revert HEAD

rollback a specific commit -
git reflog
git revert b998e02
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

upstream  repository-
when we clone a repo from github, the github repo is considered the upstream repo for our local repo.

upstream  branch-
if we create a branch in our local repo and push it to upstream repo,it will be referred as an upstream branch to our local branch in that local repo.

conflict merge  -
multiple developres are working on diff branches. some times they do changes on the same lines of that file and push there code to upstream branch. at the time of nerging these two branches git cant determine which changes to keep, and it stops and mark the conflict there.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic steps 

initialize the repo     git init
add files to stage      git add . (git add file1.txt file2.ts file3.html)
review changes          git status
commit                  git commit
check history           git log
rollback                git reset --hard
push                    git push

configuration
git config -l

git config --global user.name "hari"
git config --global user.email "hari@prasad.com"
git config --global color.ui auto

check git version -
git --version

---------------------------------------------------------------
i have 2 files product_1 and product_2.
i have modified both the files and run the commant git add .
now all the files are moved to stagging.
i realised that i have to do some more changes in product_1 file and then after move it to stage. but for now i have completed product_2. 
so to remove product_1 from stagging we have to run command any one from below

1. git reset product_1.ts
2. git reset HEAD product_1.ts
3. git rm --cached product_1.ts
4. git reset -p

on running this command git will not track that file.
all the content of that file will be there. no data loss.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
git diff
git diff filename.ext

this command is used to see the modification.
whether that file is tracked/untracked/staged/unstaged we can view the difference on that
----------------------------------------------------------------------
git diff --staged

we have added some files to stagging area.
we want to see the changes which are stagged  but not committed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit
git commit -m "commit message"

git log
commit 5f1b48b9162e8da5ef694b2d332adbd2d813a2c1 (HEAD -> master)    output
head will always point to new commit of tht branch

git log -p
this will gives all the details info 

git reflog
shows all the commit


git commit -a -m "commit message"
using this command we can add and commit together at same time.


to view specific commit - 
git log
copy the hash string of the commit which i want to see log then,
git show a97d735d159e7d7b8ebeae8813a91199d40ec806

remove - to remove any file we write
git rm product_2.ts

rename - to rename a file name
git mv oldfilename.ext newfilename.ext
----------------------------------------------------

branch  -

git branch
current working branch will be shown in green color with * prefix.

creatw a new branch
git branch feature_1

switch to newely created branch
git checkout feature_1

create a new branch and checkout to that branch at a same time
git checkout -b feature_2

detete specific branch - (you should not be in the same branch which you are going to delete. so checkout to other branch)
git branch -d feature_2 (if you have merged this branch to other branch)
git branch -D feature_2 (if you have not merged this branch to other branch)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rebase - 
when we want to transfer complete work of one branch to another branch we use rebase.
i have 2 branches feature_1 and feature_2. both the branches are having different files and folder.
to transfer all the work of featute_1 to feature_2, 1st we have to go to feature_ branch.
then run command

git rebase feature_1

this will not replace feature_2 with feature_1.
this will add all the work of feature one to feature_2.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stash
i a, working on branch A . Did some changes on branch A. now I have to work on branch B. 
I will try to chwckout to branch B but i got error either commit or stash changes before checkout to B, because there are some changes in branch A. I dont want to commit those changes. so here stash is used to save the changes in working directory. and now i can checkout to any oyher branch.

git stash

when i come back to branch A, i see my changes are not there which i did before stash. to get all my changes i need to run a command.

git stash pop

git stash list - list all the stash
git stash drop - drops all the satsh
